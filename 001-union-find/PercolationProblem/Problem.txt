Percolation Probability Problem

Given a N*N grid.
Each Grid can be white with probability p  and black with prob 1-p.
White means that the grid is open and black means it is closed.
You may treat it like a pathfinding problem.
The Given grid percolates if there is any path from top sites to the bottom sites. 
From any top site to any bottom site.
Find this probability p such that the given grid Percolates.
